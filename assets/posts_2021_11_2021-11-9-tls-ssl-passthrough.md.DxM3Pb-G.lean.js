SSL encrypts communications between client and server to safely send messages. When a website address says “HTTPS,” the “S” signifies that SSL is being used to encrypt data.</p><p>SSL passthrough is the action of passing data through a load balancer to a server without decrypting it. Usually, the decryption or SSL termination happens at the load balancer and data is passed along to a web server as plain HTTP. But SSL passthrough keeps the data encrypted as it travels through the load balancer. The web server does the decryption upon receipt. This process is used when security for data transfers within the local area network is especially important.</p><p>SSL passthrough is more costly because it uses more central processing unit (CPU) cycles. It also limits some functions of a load-balancing proxy. Proxy SSL passthrough does not inspect traffic or intercept SSL sessions on network devices before reaching the server since it merely passes along encrypted data. SSL passthrough is best suited for smaller deployments.</p><hr><ul><li><a href="https://avinetworks.com/glossary/ssl-passthrough" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://avinetworks.com/glossary/ssl-passthrough</a></li><li></li></ul>',9)]))}const S=t(n,[["render",i]]);export{g as __pageData,S as default};
